# GettrDl

This is a simple command line tool to yoink videos from gettr.com.<br>
expect this to break at any moment as i am blatantly poking at the api with no guarantee that it will stay this way

# Usage

download the version appropriate for your system in [releases](https://github.com/RinLovesYou/gettrdl/releases/latest)
run it in cmd like `gettrdl https://gettr.com/post/id` and it will download it to the folder it's running in.
